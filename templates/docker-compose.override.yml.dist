# Example docker-compose.override.yml
# 
# This file demonstrates how to extend Wokenv with custom services.
# Copy to docker-compose.override.yml and customize as needed.
# 
# docker-compose.override.yml is gitignored by default.

services:
  # Override wokenv service (optional)
  # wokenv:
  #   # Use different image for testing
  #   image: frugan/wokenv:node22-alpine-wpenv10
  #   
  #   # Add custom environment variables
  #   environment:
  #     - CUSTOM_VAR=value

  # Add custom services that share the same network
  # 
  # Example: Redis cache
  # redis:
  #   image: redis:alpine
  #   container_name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-redis
  #   ports:
  #     - "6379:6379"
  #   networks:
  #     - wokenv
  #
  # Example: Elasticsearch for search
  # elasticsearch:
  #   image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:latest
  #   container_name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-elasticsearch
  #   environment:
  #     - discovery.type=single-node
  #     - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
  #   ports:
  #     - "9200:9200"
  #   networks:
  #     - wokenv

networks:
  wokenv:
    external: true
